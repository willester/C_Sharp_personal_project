C # project made during 1-2 weeks during the summer vacation after the second year of university ended, using the knowledge acquired during a course at my university.
To ease my work, I used as a foundation one small project that dealt with OOP principles made for university so basically the implementation of the Windows Forms with the previous OOP project was what I did during those 1-2 weeks.
